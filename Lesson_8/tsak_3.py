# A simple calculator.
#
# Create a function called make_operation, which takes in a simple arithmetic operator
# as a first parameter (to keep things simple let it only be ‘+’, ‘-’ or ‘*’)
# and an arbitrary number of arguments (only numbers) as the second parameter.
# Then return the sum or product of all the numbers in the arbitrary parameter. For example:
#
# the call make_operation(‘+’, 7, 7, 2) should return 16
# the call make_operation(‘-’, 5, 5, -10, -20) should return 30
# the call make_operation(‘*’, 7, 6) should return 42
